            strength: "I have a lot of industry experience and an understanding of how things work in that context. Manufacturing processes and how things are made is a passion of mine. I am very good at keeping an eye on the bigger picture, aligning and meditating team work. Communication is key, I‚Äôm a fan, and no need to sugarcoat anything as long as it‚Äôs respectful. I can make pretty much anything textile related, but also wood, clay, metal etc and I enjoy and am good at using scraps and anything i can find to make quick prototypes. Pretty much anything to be done by hand, I‚Äôm your gal :)",
            weakness: "I am sensitive and NOT good in loud spaces and chaotic environments (I.e. battersea ü§£). I have limited capabilities in most software except Adobe Suite, and have been quite frustrated that there hasn‚Äôt been time to skill up yet, as I would like to learn! I am a starter, so it‚Äôs important to have a finisher on the team, and I‚Äôm sometimes paralyzed by perfectionism, but just nudge me and I‚Äôll move on ;)",
            values: "Empowering people to take their own decisions. Not to control but to collaborate and create. Thriving. Connection (human connection, human-nature connection human-product connection or emotional attachment). Respect - for people, things, materials and processes alike - and humility (no white saviorism or technooptimism). And beauty! Because it ‚Äú‚Ä¶illuminates the affinity, the inner relation, the resemblance, the kinship, the concord and identity of things. We are all trained to tell things apart. In the experience of beauty, we learn to tell things alike‚Äù",
            workEthics: "I am a team player, mostly night owl, and I take the time and space I need to stay as sharp as I can be, so I will stay away from endless work days and weekend work.

If we find a good work station setup, and the project and team is engaging, I can have pretty limitless energy though.",
            topicsYoureInterestedIn: "More than a consumer facing product, I am interested in the frameworks and processes that enable and empower others to create or repair said products. An automated production process, a business model or a design software for example. (Not necessarily in textiles though that‚Äôs of course where I have most knowledge.) I would be keen to do a quite engineer-led project if the team is there for that. A CAD printer? an innovative mold-making process? a sock-mending robot? a scrap-scanning-and reorganizing software? idk.",

            background: "I took Product Design for my undergraduate degree and then worked as a Design Researcher and Strategist for almost six years. I have worked in various industries, including e-commerce, circular fashion, and fintech, helping technology startups (mainly digital) design, develop, release, and evaluate their products across multiple countries in Asia - Pacific. My role as a Design Researcher involved looking at the macro level of business, market, and strategy while also focusing on the micro level of how a product should be built to achieve product-market fit.",
            strength: "I am a fast learner, natural observer + analyst, also a deep thinker. I am able to see things through different lenses. There is terminology in my native language, \"ngulik\" means looking into detail, which represents me as a person; I can see both the big picture and the small picture at once, and most of the time, when I see something, I see it systematically to understand how it is happening. I am very humanist, empathetic, caring, listener, highly adaptive. I am good at design software (both 3D and Adobe) and can learn new software quickly. I am very logical and feeling person, though it sounds contradictory but that helps me in judging things not just based on logic but also feel. I wouldn't mind getting my hands dirty, I like doing things hands-on (tinkering) and love to go to the field to see and feel the real situation. According to the concept of \"Human Design\" (Google it, it's cool), I am considered a Generator, which means I naturally have a lot of energy and focus for work. Additionally, I have an open Crown Center, meaning I get most of my ideas from external sources, easily inspired by people and my surroundings. That's why I love to explore new places and be around you guys!",
            weakness: "The way I think might be unconventional, and I can be an over-thinker who sometimes gets overwhelmed and lost in my thoughts. This is related to my strength, as I can easily become fascinated by complex subjects. So, at times, I can be the guide for the team, but sometimes I am the one who needs guidance (pull me out of my mind and bring me to the ground). I don't have strong technical engineering skills (coding, mechanical engineering, chemistry, biology, etc.), but I do have a love and joy for exploring these areas. I noticed that I have an accent that may not be easy to understand, speak too fast, and grammatically wrong. But I feel I am getting better now as I speak with you more, I learn more. The way I learn is by reading and observing, which sometimes takes time, but when I understand something as a whole, I can quickly help explore both the bigger and smaller picture. Sometimes I may feel insecure, not confident, weak, and hard on myself. Please support me if you see me in this state.",
            values: "My belief in humanity and making something meaningful: I believe in the inherent goodness and potential of humanity. Despite the challenges and setbacks we face, I have faith that people can come together to create positive change for both individuals and the planet. I have worked in environments where companies or projects focused on profit over impact, and where human beings were exploited for someone else's benefit. I don't want to be a designer who causes another problem by exploiting nature or uses design to influence people to buy or adopt things that are not good for themselves or the planet.",
            workEthics: "I am a team player and wouldn't leave my teammate if they respect me as well. Communication and respect are the keys to a successful team. My work ethic involves setting aside emotions and ego to focus on team objectives. I am not a starter, but I can guide a starter. I have extensive experience facilitating workshops, making me more of a process and exploration person. I build ideas on top of others' ideas. Lastly, when I work on something I love, trust, or believe in, I am very 100% focused.",
