I have worked in various industries, including e-commerce, circular fashion, and fintech, helping technology startups (mainly digital) design, develop, release, and evaluate their products across multiple countries in Asia - Pacific. My role as a Design Researcher involved looking at the macro level of business, market, and strategy while also focusing on the micro level of how a product should be built to achieve product-market fit.",
            strength: "I am a fast learner, natural observer + analyst, also a deep thinker. I am able to see things through different lenses. There is terminology in my native language, \"ngulik\" means looking into detail, which represents me as a person; I can see both the big picture and the small picture at once, and most of the time, when I see something, I see it systematically to understand how it is happening. I am very humanist, empathetic, caring, listener, highly adaptive. I am good at design software (both 3D and Adobe) and can learn new software quickly. I am very logical and feeling person, though it sounds contradictory but that helps me in judging things not just based on logic but also feel. I wouldn't mind getting my hands dirty, I like doing things hands-on (tinkering) and love to go to the field to see and feel the real situation. According to the concept of \"Human Design\" (Google it, it's cool), I am considered a Generator, which means I naturally have a lot of energy and focus for work. Additionally, I have an open Crown Center, meaning I get most of my ideas from external sources, easily inspired by people and my surroundings. That's why I love to explore new places and be around you guys!",
            weakness: "The way I think might be unconventional, and I can be an over-thinker who sometimes gets overwhelmed and lost in my thoughts. This is related to my strength, as I can easily become fascinated by complex subjects. So, at times, I can be the guide for the team, but sometimes I am the one who needs guidance (pull me out of my mind and bring me to the ground). I don't have strong technical engineering skills (coding, mechanical engineering, chemistry, biology, etc.), but I do have a love and joy for exploring these areas. I noticed that I have an accent that may not be easy to understand, speak too fast, and grammatically wrong. But I feel I am getting better now as I speak with you more, I learn more. The way I learn is by reading and observing, which sometimes takes time, but when I understand something as a whole, I can quickly help explore both the bigger and smaller picture. Sometimes I may feel insecure, not confident, weak, and hard on myself. Please support me if you see me in this state.",

Despite the challenges and setbacks we face, I have faith that people can come together to create positive change for both individuals and the planet. I have worked in environments where companies or projects focused on profit over impact, and where human beings were exploited for someone else's benefit. I don't want to be a designer who causes another problem by exploiting nature or uses design to influence people to buy or adopt things that are not good for themselves or the planet.",
            workEthics: "I am a team player and wouldn't leave my teammate if they respect me as well. Communication and respect are the keys to a successful team. My work ethic involves setting aside emotions and ego to focus on team objectives. I am not a starter, but I can guide a starter. I have extensive experience facilitating workshops, making me more of a process and exploration person. I build ideas on top of others' ideas. Lastly, when I work on something I love, trust, or believe in, I am very 100% focused.",

An environment where any idea or course of action can be challenged freely creates stronger outcomes\n- Strategic Dominant: Overall bias in strategic thinking and domain compliments my ability to analyze information, anticipate challenges before they happen, and formulate effective plans\n- Outcome Driven: While I bias toward strategic thinking, I also recognize aspects of trying to create and turn ideas into something real within the constraints of time or resources",
            weakness: "A few potential downsides about me:\nNow, while I'm excited to work together, I also want to acknowledge my potential blind spots.\n\nSometimes I can get caught up in finding the perfect solution and consider the potential pros and cons of every approach, which might make me seem overly critical. I might also get so focused on the big picture that I have built in my mind, that I choose to overlook certain details or overlook what's happening right now.\n\nMy consideration to both include but also identify where others might play the best role in specific aspects of the project, might also make me appear to prioritize individual needs over the group's needs. I've come to understand through introspection that others can have distinct, opposing, parallel, or tangential thought processes to my own; which I am working on more effectively integrating in my decision making processes.\n\nI tend to ignore prior processes and constraints. Considering that the vision of what is to be achieved to be of extreme importance. But in instances like these I will almost always shamelessly ask others who might have expertise in areas that I would be deficient in knowing the possible downsides of a particular approach or angle.",

I believe in a realistic approach to breaks with the normal being regular breaks following sprints of focused work.\n\nAs I've lead many teams in the past I'll constantly ask how every one is doing. I also believe that if there are differences or disagreements to lean into the problem and solve the conflict as best as possible and as soon as possible.\n\nI may go on a walk or get a coffee in the middle of the day not just a means to just take a break but also to synthesize in my head all of the insights and data gathered from conversations or desk research. I often will come up with my best ideas, workarounds, or solutions by simple setting changes such as this.",
