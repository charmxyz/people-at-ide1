            strength: "I am a fast learner, natural observer + analyst, also a deep thinker. I am able to see things through different lenses. There is terminology in my native language, \"ngulik\" means looking into detail, which represents me as a person; I can see both the big picture and the small picture at once, and most of the time, when I see something, I see it systematically to understand how it is happening. I am very humanist, empathetic, caring, listener, highly adaptive. I am good at design software (both 3D and Adobe) and can learn new software quickly. I am very logical and feeling person, though it sounds contradictory but that helps me in judging things not just based on logic but also feel. I wouldn't mind getting my hands dirty, I like doing things hands-on (tinkering) and love to go to the field to see and feel the real situation. According to the concept of \"Human Design\" (Google it, it's cool), I am considered a Generator, which means I naturally have a lot of energy and focus for work. Additionally, I have an open Crown Center, meaning I get most of my ideas from external sources, easily inspired by people and my surroundings. That's why I love to explore new places and be around you guys!",
            weakness: "The way I think might be unconventional, and I can be an over-thinker who sometimes gets overwhelmed and lost in my thoughts. This is related to my strength, as I can easily become fascinated by complex subjects. So, at times, I can be the guide for the team, but sometimes I am the one who needs guidance (pull me out of my mind and bring me to the ground). I don't have strong technical engineering skills (coding, mechanical engineering, chemistry, biology, etc.), but I do have a love and joy for exploring these areas. I noticed that I have an accent that may not be easy to understand, speak too fast, and grammatically wrong. But I feel I am getting better now as I speak with you more, I learn more. The way I learn is by reading and observing, which sometimes takes time, but when I understand something as a whole, I can quickly help explore both the bigger and smaller picture. Sometimes I may feel insecure, not confident, weak, and hard on myself. Please support me if you see me in this state.",

I have worked in environments where companies or projects focused on profit over impact, and where human beings were exploited for someone else's benefit.

I might also get so focused on the big picture that I have built in my mind, that I choose to overlook certain details or overlook what's happening right now.\n\nMy consideration to both include but also identify where others might play the best role in specific aspects of the project, might also make me appear to prioritize individual needs over the group's needs. I've come to understand through introspection that others can have distinct, opposing, parallel, or tangential thought processes to my own; which I am working on more effectively integrating in my decision making processes.\n\nI tend to ignore prior processes and constraints.

I excel at uncovering detailed information, often remain calm and approachable. I am always willing to challenge myself with new experiences.",
            weakness: "I might be too divergent thinking sometimes, which leads to unconventional ideas. I need quiet time to think and am a slow thinker, requiring more time to process information and articulate my thoughts. I easily compromise with others and prefer to avoid arguments.",
            values: "The process of the project drives me; I don't usually set clear goals. Instead, I start with an unclear goal and explore different ways to solve it. My goal could change depending on the process.",
            workEthics: "I am a night owl and an independent worker. If I present a bad idea, feel free to tell me directly, and I hope I can do the same with you. I believe the right way to approach a project is through hands-on experimentation rather than spending all day in meetings or discussions. I prefer quickly verifying ideas, even if they already sound very bad.",

I've had systematic exposure to industrial production and I understand a lot of production related knowledge. I can do some animation and graphic related stuff too.",
            strength: "Enjoys using knowledge from other disciplines to solve problems, observes strange phenomena and discovers their essence, good at listening and giving help, good at mediating conflicts, e.g., often resolves conflicts between electrical and structural engineers.",
            weakness: "My programming skills are weak (I'm still self-taught) and I'm more inspiration-driven so I sometimes don't pay attention to details (but I'm perfectly capable of polishing it up really nicely if you give me time).",

I have worked as a designer and engineer (Design Engineer when combined together :p) designing lights, objects and furniture and the systems around them. I have also spent some time as a design & material consultant focusing on traditional Indian craftsmanship and material.",
            strength: "I believe I am a person who gives and acts of service is my language. I am an avid maker and love getting my hands dirty in the process of making and prototyping. I am someone who will leave no one behind. I am a storyteller and love building a narrative around what we do. I am a communicator and will be very straightforward with what I think and I am very punctual as a person. I am usually very calm and relaxed with the mindset that as long as we are putting in the effort, when times get hard - things will work out in the end.",
            weakness: "I sometimes go through moments of low self confidence and begin to start doubting my abilities and capabilities. I do get overwhelmed when I am tasked with a lot of things to do and have a bad habit to say yes to many things. I also feel a little uneasy especially when the energy shifts around me. When my hair is long and I haven't cut it, I tend to look perpetually tired but trust me I am not.\n\nIn terms of skills, I say that I am not a very good engineer, my mind doesn't think like that. If I apply myself I will be able to get up to speed with engineering tasks. I also don't know how to code or render very well (willing to learn and skill up).",

            workEthics: "I like structure and having my week planned out with tasks, milestones etc. I have become very much of an early bird. I am a team player and at times would like to have some time for myself to do my research independently. As much as possible, I love to have my weekends to rest and recharge. I like to have a good work-life balance and diet as well. And I am not sure if this comes under work ethic but I would love my team to be on time as much as possible (for me people's time needs to be respected). I tend to not be able to work in spaces that are very loud, new or just cluttered. I can also be spontaneous and I am always willing to be experimental. I also do enjoy adding a few elements that will make people laugh in every project and/or presentation.",
            topicsYoureInterestedIn: "I love storytelling. Stories for me are what makes people go aha and I would love to explore the topics that create these 'Aha Moments'. I am very much interested in working on a topic that gives back to the planet either directly or indirectly - exploring future of materials, electronics as well as systems and frameworks that impact and add value to people using them and thus planet they are based in and vice versa (context driven is key). I am also very interested in fun and exciting inventions and innovations because they make me go aha - Novelty Automations or Kew Gardens anyone?",
            topicsYouWantToAvoid: "I would avoid Healthcare or anything related to Outer Space. I also very much dislike mass-manufactured consumer goods or pure digital things like apps.
